🖥 Compatibility

    Important: This project has been developed and tested exclusively on Linux Mint 22.3 (Zena) using the Cinnamon desktop environment and Nemo file manager. While it may work on other Debian-based systems, your experience may vary regarding window layering and desktop icon transparency.

🤝 Collaboration & Support

I am actively looking for feedback, bug reports, and collaborators! Whether you are an artist wanting to create presets, a developer interested in the engine's layering logic, or just a user with a cool idea:

    Discord: Add me as a friend at nepputty

I’d love to see what kind of interactive wallpapers you create or hear about your experience running this on your setup!
🚀 Quick Start

    Download the MintpaperEngine folder.

    Terminal: Run chmod +x setup.sh && ./setup.sh.

    Menu: Search for "Mintpaper Engine" and enjoy.

Final Packaging Tip

When you're ready to share the .zip, make sure you've deleted the venv/ folder and any startup_error.log files. This keeps the download small and ensures the setup.sh builds a fresh, compatible environment for the person downloading it.

Would you like me to help you create a presets/ guide to include in the README so people know how to make their own custom HTML wallpapers for your engine?
